# üñºÔ∏è AI Image Classifier

This is a simple web-based image classification app built with **Streamlit**, **TensorFlow (Keras)**, and **OpenCV**. It uses the pre-trained **MobileNetV2** model to identify the contents of uploaded images and returns the top 3 predictions.

## üöÄ Features

- Upload JPG or PNG images
- Classify images using the MobileNetV2 model trained on ImageNet
- Get top 3 predicted classes with confidence scores
- Simple and intuitive Streamlit UI

## üì¶ Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit tensorflow opencv-python pillow numpy
```

## How To Run
1. save the scripts(e.g `main.py`)
2. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

3. A browser window will open. Upload an image and click "Classify Image" to see predictions

## Model Details

- Model Used: `MobileNetV2
- Weights: Pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset
- Input Image Size: (Note: MobileNetV2 expects 224x244 input)

## Known Issues
- The image is resized to `244x244` in code, which is not ideal for MobileNetV2. Recommended to use `224x224`.
- There is a variable name conflict in `classify_image()` function `(preprocess_image = preprocess_image(...))`, which can break the code. Consider renaming the variable or the function to avoid shadowing.
