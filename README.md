#  AI Image Classifier

This is a simple web-based image classification app built with **Streamlit**, **TensorFlow (Keras)**, and **OpenCV**. It uses the pre-trained **MobileNetV2** model to identify the contents of uploaded images and returns the top 3 predictions.

---

##  Features

- Upload JPG or PNG images
- Classify images using the MobileNetV2 model trained on ImageNet
- Get top 3 predicted classes with confidence scores
- Simple and intuitive Streamlit UI

---

##  Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit tensorflow opencv-python pillow numpy
```

## How To Run
1. save the scripts(e.g `main.py`)
2. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

3. A browser window will open. Upload an image and click "Classify Image" to see predictions

##  Code Explanation

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each part of the script does:

### `load_model()`
- Loads the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model with ImageNet weights.
- This model can classify 1000 types of objects from images.

### `preprocess_image(image)`
- Converts the image into a NumPy array.
- Resizes it to 244x244 (should ideally be 224x224 for MobileNetV2).
- Applies preprocessing (normalization) required by MobileNetV2.
- Adds a batch dimension so the model can process it.

### `classify_image(model, image)`
- Takes the model and a preprocessed image.
- Predicts the class using the model.
- Decodes the top 3 predictions to readable labels and confidence scores.
- Handles any errors with a Streamlit error message.

### `main()`
- Streamlit UI starts here.
- Displays the app title and file uploader.
- Loads the model with caching to prevent reloading every time.
- Shows the uploaded image.
- When the "Classify Image" button is clicked:
  - The image is passed to the model for classification.
  - The top 3 predicted labels and scores are displayed.



## Model Details

- Model Used: `MobileNetV2
- Weights: Pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset
- Input Image Size: (Note: MobileNetV2 expects 224x244 input)

## Known Issues
- The image is resized to `244x244` in code, which is not ideal for MobileNetV2. Recommended to use `224x224`.
- There is a variable name conflict in `classify_image()` function `(preprocess_image = preprocess_image(...))`, which can break the code. Consider renaming the variable or the function to avoid shadowing.

## To Do 
- Fix image resize size to 224x224
- Rename conflicting variable names
- Add webcam support
- Improve UI with drag-and-drop or preview
- Support multiple models (e.g., ResNet, Inception)
